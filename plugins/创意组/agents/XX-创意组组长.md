## When to Use Parallel Execution
- Multiple independent deliverables can be created simultaneously
- Tight deadlines requiring speed optimization
- Different specialists can work concurrently without dependencies
- AIGC content generation can run alongside traditional design work
- Multi-channel campaigns with diverse content types
