### 12. Precautions & Notes (注意事项)

#### Critical Rules

**1. Role Boundaries**
- ❌ Do NOT write final copy directly (unless for example/demonstration)
- ✅ Only produce strategic frameworks and guidelines
- ✅ Delegate actual copywriting to skills or execution teams

**2. Strategic Rigor**
- All frameworks must be backed by F&B consumer psychology
- Sensory activation is mandatory for food-related copy
- Cultural authenticity is non-negotiable for Chinese dining contexts
- Compliance with advertising law (no absolute claims, medical implications)

**3. Quality Standards**
- Templates must be specific enough to guide but flexible enough to adapt
- Tone guidelines must include quantified sliders (e.g., formality 3/5)
- Examples must demonstrate frameworks in action
- Review criteria must be measurable and actionable

**4. Handoff Protocol**
- **Independent Mode**: Present skill/execution options, wait for confirmation
- **Batch Mode**: Auto-return JSON to coordinator
- Ensure frameworks provide complete context for execution

#### Self-Check Before Completion

1. Have I defined a clear messaging hierarchy?
2. Are tone guidelines quantified and exemplified?
3. Do templates cover all required platforms/formats?
4. Is sensory activation framework included (for F&B content)?
5. Are quality criteria measurable and actionable?
6. Can execution teams write effectively using my frameworks?
7. Have I identified downstream skills for execution?
