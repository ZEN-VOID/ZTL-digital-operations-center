# Canvas Design for Restaurant Industry

Create stunning visual designs for restaurant branding materials including posters, menu covers, packaging, signage, and marketing collateral. This skill applies professional design philosophy and principles specifically tailored to the restaurant industry's unique needs.

## Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Visual Communication Principles

**Hierarchy**: Guide the viewer's eye through deliberate scale, contrast, and positioning
- Primary focus: Hero element (dish photo, brand logo, key message)
- Secondary elements: Supporting information (price, description, CTA)
- Tertiary elements: Background, texture, decorative accents

**Balance**: Create visual stability while maintaining interest
- Symmetrical: Traditional, stable, trustworthy (fine dining, formal restaurants)
- Asymmetrical: Dynamic, modern, interesting (casual dining, trendy cafes)
- Radial: Circular focus, gathering (hotpot, shared dining concepts)

**Color Theory**: Evoke appetite and emotion
- Warm colors (red, orange, yellow): Stimulate appetite, energy, excitement
- Cool colors (blue, green): Freshness, health, tranquility
- Neutrals (beige, brown, cream): Comfort, tradition, earthiness

**Typography**: Communicate brand personality
- Serif: Traditional, refined, established (fine dining, steakhouses)
- Sans-serif: Modern, clean, approachable (fast casual, contemporary)
- Script: Elegant, personal, artisanal (cafes, boutique restaurants)
- Display: Bold, unique, memorable (bars, themed restaurants)

### 2. Restaurant-Specific Design Considerations

**Appetite Appeal**:
- High-quality food photography with proper lighting
- Warm, inviting color palettes
- Textures suggesting freshness and quality
- Compositional focus on the food hero

**Cultural Resonance**:
- Chinese: Red and gold, flowing lines, auspicious symbols
- Japanese: Minimalism, negative space, asymmetric balance
- Italian: Rustic textures, rich colors, family warmth
- French: Elegance, sophistication, refined details
- American: Bold, friendly, abundant

**Practical Durability**:
- Consider real-world usage (grease resistance for menus)
- Readability in various lighting conditions
- Scalability across different sizes (business card to banner)
- Print production requirements (bleeds, CMYK, resolution)

**Speed of Recognition**:
- Clear brand identification at a glance
- Immediate message comprehension
- Distinctive visual signature
- Memorable design elements

## Design Categories

# Follow output instructions to complete the design
```

**Manual Workflow**:

   - Digital: PNG (RGB, 150-300 DPI)

### Workflow 2: Menu Cover

1. **Understand Brand**: Review VI guidelines, brand personality
2. **Choose Direction**:
   - Minimalist elegance

### Pre-Flight Checklist

**Technical**:
- [ ] Resolution is 300 DPI minimum (print) or appropriate for digital
- [ ] Color mode is correct (CMYK for print, RGB for screens)
- [ ] Bleed is included (3-5mm) if required
- [ ] Safe zone margins are respected

- [ ] Brand logo is clear and properly placed
- [ ] Typography hierarchy is evident
- [ ] Colors match brand guidelines
- [ ] Text is readable at intended size
- [ ] Visual balance is achieved
- [ ] White space is used strategically

**Content**:
- [ ] All text is spell-checked
- [ ] Prices are accurate (if applicable)
- [ ] Contact information is correct
- [ ] Dates and times are verified
- [ ] Legal disclaimers included (if required)

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works seamlessly with**:
- `algorithmic-art-restaurant`: Use generated patterns as background elements
- `brand-guidelines-restaurant`: Ensure adherence to brand standards
- `theme-factory-restaurant`: Apply consistent themes across materials
- `figma/*`: Export designs from Figma for final production

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Content**: Design around the message, not the other way around
2. **Less is More**: Avoid clutter; embrace white space
3. **Consistency**: Maintain visual language across all materials
4. **Test at Size**: View designs at actual intended size (print or screen)
5. **Consider Context**: Design for the environment (lighting, distance, usage)
6. **Print Samples**: For print projects, always request physical proofs
7. **Archive Properly**: Save layered source files, not just flattened exports
8. **Document Decisions**: Maintain design rationale for future reference

## Common Design Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Overcrowding**: Too many elements competing for attention
❌ **Poor Hierarchy**: Everything looks equally important (nothing stands out)
❌ **Wrong Color Mode**: Using RGB for print (results in dull colors)
❌ **Low Resolution**: Pixelated images ruin professional designs
❌ **Inconsistent Branding**: Logo sizes and placements vary randomly
❌ **Unreadable Text**: Poor contrast or too-small font sizes
❌ **Ignoring Bleeds**: Content too close to trim edges
❌ **Cultural Insensitivity**: Using inappropriate symbols or colors
