# MiniMax Video Prompt Optimizer

## üìã Overview

This skill optimizes prompts for MiniMax Video Generation APIs (`mcp__minimax-mcp__generate_video`), transforming user creative intentions into technically precise video generation requests that produce professional-quality cinematic content.

**Supported Models**:
- **T2V-01**: Text-to-Video (standard generation)
- **T2V-01-Director**: Text-to-Video with camera movement control
- **I2V-01**: Image-to-Video (animate static images)
- **I2V-01-Director**: Image-to-Video with camera control
- **I2V-01-live**: Image-to-Video for live-action style
- **MiniMax-Hailuo-02**: Latest ultra-clear model with precise response

**Core Value**: Bridge the gap between creative vision ("I need a hotpot promotional video") and technical API requirements (structured prompts with subject + motion + camera + atmosphere).

## üéØ Quick Start

```python
# Basic T2V usage
input = "ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫óËèúÂìÅÂ±ïÁ§∫ËßÜÈ¢ë"
optimized = optimize_video_prompt(input, model="T2V-01")
# Output: {
#   "model": "T2V-01",
#   "prompt": "Close-up of bubbling Sichuan hotpot with fresh ingredients, steam rising elegantly, chopsticks lifting red chili peppers and beef slices, warm ambient lighting, appetizing cinematic style",
#   "duration": 6,
#   "resolution": "1080P"
# }

# Advanced Director Mode with camera movements
input = "Â±ïÁ§∫ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫óÁéØÂ¢É,‰ªéÂÖ•Âè£Êé®ËøõÂà∞Áî®È§êÂå∫"
optimized = optimize_video_prompt(input, model="T2V-01-Director")
# Output: {
#   "prompt": "[Push in] Entrance of modern hotpot restaurant with red lanterns, [Pan right] revealing cozy dining area with customers, warm inviting atmosphere, cinematic establishing shot"
# }

# I2V usage (animate existing image)
input = {
  "first_frame_image": "path/to/dish_photo.jpg",
  "creative_brief": "ËÆ©ËèúÂìÅÂÜíÂá∫ÁÉ≠Ê∞î,Á≠∑Â≠êÂ§πËµ∑‰∏ÄÁâáËÇâ"
}
optimized = optimize_video_prompt(input, model="I2V-01")
# Output: {
#   "model": "I2V-01",
#   "first_frame_image": "path/to/dish_photo.jpg",
#   "prompt": "Steam rises from hotpot, chopsticks lift a piece of meat from the bubbling broth, appetizing motion"
# }
```

| **Follow** | `[Tracking shot]` | Follow moving subject |
| **Static** | `[Static shot]` | No camera movement |

**Usage Rules**:
- Maximum 3 camera movements per prompt
- Use square brackets: `[Push in]`
- Combine movements: `[Truck left, Pan right, Zoom in]`
- Best practice: 1-2 movements for stability

### 3. Precise Prompt Formula

#### T2V-01-Director Structure:
```
[Camera Movement] + Main Subject + Scene + Motion + [Camera Movement] + Aesthetic Atmosphere
```

**Example**:
```
[Push in] Close-up of steaming Sichuan hotpot with vibrant red broth,
fresh beef slices and vegetables floating, [Zoom in] focusing on rising steam,
warm golden lighting, appetizing cinematic food photography style
```

#### I2V-01 Structure:
```
Main Subject in first frame + Motion/Change + Camera movement (optional)
```

**Example** (with first frame image):
```
First Frame: Static dish photo of hotpot
Prompt: "Steam rises from the bubbling broth, chopsticks enter frame and lift
a piece of meat, [Tilt down] camera reveals full table setting, warm ambiance"

## üìö Best Practices

### Camera Movement Guidelines

#### 1. One Camera Movement (Simplest)
- **Best for**: Beginners, simple reveals
- **Example**: `[Push in] Close-up of hotpot dish, steam rising`
- **Stability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

#### 2. Two Camera Movements (Recommended)
- **Best for**: Professional look, storytelling
- **Example**: `[Pan right] Restaurant interior, [Tilt down] focusing on table setting`
- **Stability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

#### 3. Three Camera Movements (Advanced)
- **Best for**: Complex cinematography, experienced users
- **Example**: `[Truck left, Pan right, Zoom in] following waiter through dining room`
- **Stability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (may cause issues if overused)

### Prompt Engineering Principles

#### 1. Subject Clarity
- ‚ùå Vague: "È§êÂéÖËßÜÈ¢ë"
- ‚úÖ Clear: "Modern hotpot restaurant interior with red lanterns and marble tables"

#### 2. Motion Description
- ‚ùå Static: "‰∏ÄÁõòÁÅ´ÈîÖ"
- ‚úÖ Dynamic: "Bubbling hotpot with steam rising, chopsticks lifting beef slices"

#### 3. Aesthetic Atmosphere
- ‚ùå Missing: "ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫óÁéØÂ¢É"
- ‚úÖ Complete: "ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫óÁéØÂ¢É, warm inviting atmosphere, cinematic golden hour lighting"

#### 4. Camera Movement Logic
- ‚ùå Random: `[Shake, Zoom in, Pan left]` (chaotic)
- ‚úÖ Logical: `[Push in, Tilt down]` (smooth transition)

### Model Selection Strategy

```yaml
Decision Tree:

Have first frame image?
  Yes ‚Üí Use I2V-01 series
    Need camera control? ‚Üí I2V-01-Director
    Live-action style? ‚Üí I2V-01-live
    Standard animation? ‚Üí I2V-01

  No ‚Üí Use T2V-01 series or Hailuo-02
    Need precise camera control? ‚Üí T2V-01-Director
    Need premium quality (1080P/10s)? ‚Üí MiniMax-Hailuo-02
    Quick standard generation? ‚Üí T2V-01
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **‚ùå Too Many Camera Movements**
   - Using all 15 movements in one prompt
   - **Fix**: Limit to 1-2 movements, 3 maximum

2. **‚ùå Conflicting Camera Directions**
   - `[Pan left, Pan right]` in same prompt
   - **Fix**: Choose one consistent direction

3. **‚ùå Missing Subject Focus**
   - Only camera movements, no subject description
   - **Fix**: Always describe what the camera is seeing

4. **‚ùå Wrong Model for Task**
   - Using T2V for animating existing dish photo
   - **Fix**: Use I2V-01 for first-frame animation

5. **‚ùå Ignoring Duration Limits**
   - Trying to generate 30-second video
   - **Fix**: Current limit is 6s (standard) or 10s (Hailuo-02)

## üöÄ Workflow Integration

### Step 1: Receive Input
```python
# From X11-AIGCËßÜÈ¢ëÁîüÊàê agent
raw_input = {
  "creative_brief": "ÁÅ´ÈîÖÂ∫óËèúÂìÅÂ±ïÁ§∫,Ë¶ÅÊúâËí∏Ê±ΩÂíåÁ≠∑Â≠êÂ§πËµ∑È£üÊùêÁöÑÈïúÂ§¥",
  "restaurant_type": "hotpot",
  "video_purpose": "menu-showcase"
}
```

### Step 2: Analyze & Select Model
```python
from scripts.optimizer import VideoPromptOptimizer

optimizer = VideoPromptOptimizer()

# Optimizer decides: Menu showcase ‚Üí I2V-01 best (if first frame available)
# Or T2V-01-Director (if generating from scratch with camera control)
```

### Step 3: Optimize Prompt
```python
optimized = optimizer.optimize(raw_input)

# Output:
# {
#   "model": "T2V-01-Director",
#   "prompt": "[Push in] Close-up of bubbling Sichuan hotpot with red broth,
#              [Zoom in] steam rising elegantly, chopsticks lift beef slice,
#              warm appetizing lighting, cinematic food photography"
# }
```

### Step 4: Validate & Call API
```python
validated = optimizer.validate_for_api(optimized)

result = mcp__minimax-mcp__generate_video(
  model=validated["model"],
  prompt=validated["prompt"],
  duration=validated.get("duration", 6),  # Hailuo-02 only
  resolution=validated.get("resolution", "1080P"),  # Hailuo-02 only
  output_directory=f"output/{project_name}/X11-AIGCËßÜÈ¢ëÁîüÊàê/",
  async_mode=False
)
```

### Step 5: Return Results
```python
# X11 agent receives video file
return {
  "status": "success",
  "video_file": result["file_path"],
  "optimization_details": optimized["optimization_notes"],
  "camera_movements_used": optimized["analysis"]["recommended_cameras"]
}
```
