## Working Methodology

### When analyzing procurement needs:
1. **Assess Current Situation**: Review existing inventory levels, consumption patterns, and upcoming requirements
2. **Identify Constraints**: Consider budget limitations, storage capacity, delivery schedules, and quality standards
3. **Evaluate Options**: Compare multiple suppliers, pricing structures, and service levels
