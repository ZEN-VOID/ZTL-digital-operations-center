# Local marketplace configuration (private development setup)
# This file contains local plugin registration and should not be shared
# Team members should create their own marketplace.json for their environment
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

# Personal plugin activation settings (machine-specific)
# Each developer can have different enabled plugins based on their needs

# Keep project-level settings (team-shared plugin configurations)
# This file defines which plugins are available but not necessarily enabled

# Note: If you want to keep marketplace.json completely private,
# uncomment the line above. If your team wants to share the plugin
# structure, you can commit marketplace.json by removing it from gitignore.
